                <div class="c colored">Out of the 6 friends, these are the only two that do not get together at any time during the show. They remain best friends, and do flirt every few episodes, but never engage in a relationship with one another. Joey, a stuggling actor, is a ladies man. His famous catchphrase, "How ya doin," always got him the girl that he wanted. Pheobe, a struggling masseuse, is the weirdest character out of all of them. We never really learn about her character, except that her dad ran away when she was little, and her mom commited suicide. Joey lands a huge role on a soap opera show in the third season, but loses it later becasue of lying in an interview, and becasuae of that he refuses to take any small roles, which lands him in the world of bankrupty where he stays for the rest of the show. Phoebe falls in love with a scientist, who is whisked away to Russia in a couple episodes, and then he makes special appearances in a few episodes, though Phoebe ends up marrying someone else in the tenth season.</div>
