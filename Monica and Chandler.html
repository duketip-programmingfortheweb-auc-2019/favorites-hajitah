            <div class="c colored">At the beginning of the show, Monica and Chandler were just friends. After a couple seasons, we learn that they knew each other from before the show started. Ross, Monica's older brother was best friends with Chandler in high school. Though they did not like each other at the beginning of the show and were just friends, after a couple of seasons, they fall in love. In season 7 they get married, and by season 10 they had adopted two twins. Though we do not find out, in the last episode, they do tell us that they are leaving the apartment that the entire show is shot in and are moving into the suburbs, and are leaving New York City. When Monica was little, she suffered with obesity. After Chandler calls her fat (this was before they were friends) she decides to lose weight, and before the end of highschool, she becomes thin. Throughout the show, we are reminded that Monica was fat when she was little. Chandler had always had a problem with his parents. They had divorced when he was little becasue of his dads preferences, and that had left a mark on him for his entire life. If anything good was happening to him, he would always overeact and get scared and mess things up.
