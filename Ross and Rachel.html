                <div class="c colored">At the beginning of the show, we discover that Ross has had a crush on Rachel, Monica's best friend, since high school. Rachel never knew about his crush, and always found him somewhat weird. In season one, when Rachel leaves her fiance at the altar for not loving him, she comes back into Ross's life, who is now divorced. They become friends, and a few episodes later Rachel realizes that she has feelings for him too. This starts them on the jounery on "will they or won't they." After breaking up with one another in the third season, they lie about their feelings for one another for the rest of the show until the last episode when they finally confess. Over the course of the show, Ross has three divorces before turning 30. This creates a lot of drama and comedy for the show. Rachel leaves her fiance at the altar in the first episode , becasue she did not love him, and comes to live with her best friend Monica. Though she was spoiled in her childhood, and had almost no skills, throughout the show, she learns how to be responsible, and get a respectable job.</div>
